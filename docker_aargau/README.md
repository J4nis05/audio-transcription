A big thank you to the people at AI + Machine Learning Canton of Zurich for this wonderful tool. We at the courts of the canton of Aargau love it.

As a small improvement, we wanted to share our dockerized version with you. Both files need to be in the project root and the .env file needs to be set up if you want to use it.
